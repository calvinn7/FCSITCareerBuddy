enhance their scientific knowledge
gain professional experience
obtain hands-on research experience
interact with faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students
attend group meeting sessions to learn about in-progress projects
present their research at a special session at the end of the training

you may choose three (3) of the research unit below for application purpose:
a) cancer prevention & population science
conducts research in the asian population to determine a person’s risk of cancer and to find ways to reduce the risk. we now know that both inherited genetic factors and lifetime exposure to risk factors (such as tobacco, alcohol, diet, obesity and exercise, our microbiome, our hormones, environmental pollutants and infections) combine to put a person at risk of cancer. we aim to develop a better understanding of these genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors in the asian population and to develop interventions to enable prevention and early detection of cancer.
b) genomics & bioinformatics
develops comprehensive molecular genetic analyses of cancers common in asia. our primary goal is to identify the population-specific molecular, genetic, immunological and micro-environmental features in cancers in asian populations, using new sequencing technologies and histopathological knowledge. armed with this knowledge, we aim to discover new therapeutic and diagnostic targets and biomarkers, and to evaluate and uncover known and unknown carcinogens by mutational signature analyses for cancer prevention.
c) translational cancer biology
investigates the critical genetic, molecular and cellular changes underlying cancer development, focusing on cancers that disproportionately affect asians [such as oral and nasopharyngeal cancers]. as de novo drug development is a lengthy and costly process, we aim to identify drugs that have been developed for other diseases or other types of cancers which have the potential to be repurposed for head and neck cancers. using cancer genomics, cell biology and cancer drug response, we aim to identify new therapeutic approaches to oral and nasopharyngeal cancer. 
d) cancer immunology and immunotherapy
develops systemic immunotherapeutic approaches to improve patient outcome. our goal is to identify ways by which the immune system can be modulated for cancer treatment and develop effective immunotherapy for cancers especially cancers that are common in the asian region.
e) clinical trials
translates internal scientific discoveries to the clinic through clinical trials to enable personalized cancer treatment and early adoption of innovative therapies in malaysia. our focus is initiating investigational oncology studies with clinical and biological endpoints, in partnership with clinicians, research institutions, hospitals and commercial sponsors like pharmaceutical companies. 
f) core laboratory
brings together skills in biospecimen collections and genetic technologies to provide the platform for translational cancer research and adoption of precision medicine in malaysia.
g) genetic counselling
conducts research in methods to improve access to genetic counselling and testing to the population. we examine the communication and psychosocial needs of the diverse asian communities in malaysia, focusing on the needs of patients and their family members in relation to genetic testing for hereditary cancers. 
h) community outreach
collaboratively develops intervention programmes to promote early detection and improve access to breast cancer care for women seeking treatment at ministry of health hospitals.
i) digital health
develops and evaluates innovative strategies that facilitates the early detection of cancer, focusing on cancers common in the asian population. digital health includes mobile health, wearable devices, telehealth and telemedicine. these technologies can empower consumers to make better informed decisions about their own health, and provide new options for facilitating prevention, early diagnosis and management of cancer outside of traditional care settings.

conducts research in the asian population to determine a person’s risk of cancer and to find ways to reduce the risk. we now know that both inherited genetic factors and lifetime exposure to risk factors (such as tobacco, alcohol, diet, obesity and exercise, our microbiome, our hormones, environmental pollutants and infections) combine to put a person at risk of cancer. we aim to develop a better understanding of these genetic, lifestyle and environmental risk factors in the asian population and to develop interventions to enable prevention and early detection of cancer.
b) genomics & bioinformatics
develops comprehensive molecular genetic analyses of cancers common in asia. our primary goal is to identify the population-specific molecular, genetic, immunological and micro-environmental features in cancers in asian populations, using new sequencing technologies and histopathological knowledge. armed with this knowledge, we aim to discover new therapeutic and diagnostic targets and biomarkers, and to evaluate and uncover known and unknown carcinogens by mutational signature analyses for cancer prevention.
c) translational cancer biology
investigates the critical genetic, molecular and cellular changes underlying cancer development, focusing on cancers that disproportionately affect asians [such as oral and nasopharyngeal cancers]. as de novo drug development is a lengthy and costly process, we aim to identify drugs that have been developed for other diseases or other types of cancers which have the potential to be repurposed for head and neck cancers. using cancer genomics, cell biology and cancer drug response, we aim to identify new therapeutic approaches to oral and nasopharyngeal cancer. 
d) cancer immunology and immunotherapy
develops systemic immunotherapeutic approaches to improve patient outcome. our goal is to identify ways by which the immune system can be modulated for cancer treatment and develop effective immunotherapy for cancers especially cancers that are common in the asian region.
e) clinical trials
translates internal scientific discoveries to the clinic through clinical trials to enable personalized cancer treatment and early adoption of innovative therapies in malaysia. our focus is initiating investigational oncology studies with clinical and biological endpoints, in partnership with clinicians, research institutions, hospitals and commercial sponsors like pharmaceutical companies. 
f) core laboratory
brings together skills in biospecimen collections and genetic technologies to provide the platform for translational cancer research and adoption of precision medicine in malaysia.
g) genetic counselling
conducts research in methods to improve access to genetic counselling and testing to the population. we examine the communication and psychosocial needs of the diverse asian communities in malaysia, focusing on the needs of patients and their family members in relation to genetic testing for hereditary cancers. 
h) community outreach
collaboratively develops intervention programmes to promote early detection and improve access to breast cancer care for women seeking treatment at ministry of health hospitals.
i) digital health
develops and evaluates innovative strategies that facilitates the early detection of cancer, focusing on cancers common in the asian population. digital health includes mobile health, wearable devices, telehealth and telemedicine. these technologies can empower consumers to make better informed decisions about their own health, and provide new options for facilitating prevention, early diagnosis and management of cancer outside of traditional care settings.
